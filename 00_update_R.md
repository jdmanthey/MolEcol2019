Some of the computers in the computer lab are not as updated as they should be, and so the exercise last week did not work
as expected for many people. Since we do not have administrator access to re-install or fully update programs, we will
locally update R for your user profile only.

First, open the R (not RStudio) GUI, and then install the R installer package:

    install.packages("installr"); library(installr)
    
At the file menu on the top of the GUI, there should now be a tab called "installr." Click here and click "Update R." Go through 
the prompts to install R locally for your user. When this is completed, open RStudio and try to load the libraries for the genetic
structure exercises. If all the libraries loaded, you are good to go!
